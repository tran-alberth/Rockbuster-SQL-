# Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses tolaunch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

I am a data analyst in Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. 

I first loaded all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have such as: 
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Finally I compiled the results of your analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.
